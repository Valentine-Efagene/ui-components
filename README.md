# ui-components

A place where I create custom UI components

# About 

1. Uses Cypress for component testing
2. Prettier for code formatting
3. Uses React18 at the time of this commit
4. Had to force (-f) several of the dev-dependencies due to React18 limited support

# Note

1. I used the js versions of eslint config because the others did not work
2. I used the js versions of prettier config because using json caused prettier not to work
3. I also used ignorePatterns on the eslint config as opposed to an eslintignore file because the eslintignore file kept being ignored.
